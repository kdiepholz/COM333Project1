      Hi! I am a BS Computer Science student while also enrolled in Air Force ROTC. My current plans are to graduate and commission
      in May of 2020, and move to Pensacola, Florida, where I will be trained as a Combat Systems Operator (CSO). The primary role of a
      CSO is 3 parts. There is a Weapon Systems Operator (WSO), Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO), and a Navigator. While I could be
      trained in any of the three, some aircraft have all three.

      My Illinois Institute of Technology experience has been amazing. I joined Alpha Sigma Phi as a Freshman and met some great
      people. I also was on the Swim Team for 2 years, where I broke 2 records.

      Following the Air Force, I am hoping to get a job in a financial related software company. Stocks and finances have always
      interested me, and I would really like to work for a hedgefund or trading company that uses Software Engineering to trade
      and sell stocks.
